### Usage

To use this Action, include the following step in your GitHub Actions workflow:
```
      - name: "Build dependencies"
        uses: NOAA-EMC/build-nceplibs@develop
        with:
          bacio-version: v2.6.0
          w3emc-version: v2.10.0
```
which will build bacio and w3emc for the requested versions. Note that this
Action does not automatically identify dependencies, therefore it is necessary 
for the user to explicitly request versions for the entire dependency chain.

See `actions.yml` for the full list of available options and their defaults.
